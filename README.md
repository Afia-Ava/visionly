# Visionly - vision board creator

Hi! I’m building Visionly, a web app that helps people turn their goals and dreams into interactive, digital vision boards. Users can upload their own images or search from an image API, then organize their vision boards by categories like Career, Health, Travel, or Personal Growth. It’s a tool to help people visualize the life they want, and stay inspired to go after it. I’ve always believed that when you see your goals daily, you're more likely to act on them. But most vision boards are either physical or buried in photo albums, never seen again. So I wanted to build visionly to help with this!

**Tech Stack:**
HTML, CSS, JS for front-end + responsiveness
Firebase for Authentication, Firestore, Storage
Unsplash API to allow users to search high-quality images
Figma for wireframing UI/UX
Github pages to host it for now

**Some key features:**
Upload your own images or search from a library
Categorize your goals 
Save your boards with login support

**Challenges:**
Image handling was tricky, especially getting uploads, previews, and performance to all work smoothly
Designing a UI that feels motivating without being cluttered took lots of iteration
Building the onboarding flow in a way that feels natural, not like filling out a boring form

**What I Learned:**
People need both beauty and simplicity to stay engaged with their goals
Iteration matters a lot. Early versions didn’t feel “alive” enough. I kept tweaking until the experience felt like something I would use.
